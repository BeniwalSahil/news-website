JavaScript: May be used for client-side interactivity (not explicitly shown in the provided files).
Bootstrap: A CSS framework used for responsive design and layout.
5. Security Measures
Session Management: User sessions are managed to ensure that only authenticated users can access the admin panel.

9. Future Enhancements
Enhanced Security: Implement stronger password hashing and user authentication mechanisms.
User Roles: More granular user roles and permissions could be added for better access control.
